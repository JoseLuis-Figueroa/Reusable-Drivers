This project is a personal endeavor focused on developing reusable firmware for microcontroller platforms. The goal is to create a modular and efficient GPIO (called DIO) reusable driver that can be easily adapted to various microcontrollers.\hypertarget{index_version}{}\doxysection{Version Log}\label{index_version}

The software architecture follows a layered approach. This design pattern separates low-\/level code (drivers or HALs), and application-\/specific code. A layered architecture promotes reusability and simplifies the portability between different applications or microcontrollers. The layered architecture can be seen in figure 1 and contains a driver and application layer operating on the hardware.

The driver layer includes all the code (drivers) necessary to get the microcontroller and any other associated board hardware, such as sensors, buttons, and so forth, running. The application code (main) contains no driver code but has access to the low-\/level hardware through a driver-\/layer interface that hides the hardware details from the application developer but still allows them to perform a useful function.\hypertarget{index_os}{}\doxysection{OS Information}\label{index_os}
This project is developed as bare-\/metal firmware without an underlying operating system.\hypertarget{index_coding-standards}{}\doxysection{Coding Standards}\label{index_coding-standards}
The project adheres to industry-\/standard coding practices, following the MISRA-\/C guidelines. This includes consistent naming conventions, code formatting, and best practices for code organization and documentation.\hypertarget{index_requirements}{}\doxysection{Project Requirements}\label{index_requirements}
