This project is a personal endeavor focused on developing reusable firmware for microcontroller platforms. The goal is to create a modular and efficient SPI reusable driver that can be easily adapted to various microcontrollers. The DIO driver is used to configure the selected SPI port.\hypertarget{index_version}{}\doxysection{Version Log}\label{index_version}

The software architecture follows a layered approach. This design pattern separates low-\/level code (drivers or HALs), and application-\/specific code. A layered architecture promotes reusability and simplifies the portability between different applications or microcontrollers. The layered architecture can be seen in figure 1 and contains a driver and application layer operating on the hardware.

The driver layer includes all the code (drivers) necessary to get the microcontroller and any other associated board hardware, such as sensors, buttons, and so forth, running. The application code (main) contains no driver code but has access to the low-\/level hardware through a driver-\/layer interface that hides the hardware details from the application developer but still allows them to perform a useful function.\hypertarget{index_coding-standards}{}\doxysection{Coding Standards}\label{index_coding-standards}
This project is developed as bare-\/metal firmware and adheres to industry-\/standard coding practices, following the MISRA-\/C guidelines. This includes consistent naming conventions, code formatting, and best practices for code organization and documentation.\hypertarget{index_description}{}\doxysection{Project Description}\label{index_description}
The code involves the configuration of a Serial Peripheral Interface. The SPI driver is used to configure the SPI1 as a master device. The setting includes a baud rate = 4KHz, full duplex communication, an 8-\/bit data frame format, and most significant bit transmission. To establish the physical connections, the GPIO driver configures the SPI1 pins. The following table illustrates the pin connections among Nucleo board, and KY-\/57 logic analyzer\+:

In operation, the master continuously transmits data to the KY-\/57 logic analyzer for data reception and analysis, with the current involving the transmission of 0x56.\hypertarget{index_requirements}{}\doxysection{Project Requirements}\label{index_requirements}
